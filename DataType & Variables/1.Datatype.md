# Data Types

In programming, a data type is a classification or categorization that specifies which type of value a variable can hold. Data types are essential because they determine how data is stored in memory and what operations can be performed on that data. Python, like many programming languages, supports several built-in data types. Here are some of the common data types in Python:

1. **Numeric Data Types:**
   - **int**: Represents integers (whole numbers). Example: `x = 5`
   - Whole numbers, positive or negative.
   - No decimal points.
   - Can be arbitrarily large.

   ```python
      a = 10
      b = -250
       c = 1234567890123456789  # Large int
   
   - **float**: Represents floating-point numbers (numbers with decimal points). Example: `y = 3.14`
   - **complex**: Represents complex numbers. Example: `z = 2 + 3j`
                  Written as a + bj, where j is the imaginary unit (jÂ² = -1).
                  Useful in engineering, physics, signal processing.
                  z1 = 2 + 3j
                  z2 = 1 - 4j

                  print(z1 + z2)  # (3-1j)
                  print(z1 * z2)  # (14-5j)
                  print(abs(z1))  # 3.605551275463989 (magnitude)
                  print(z1.real)  # 2.0
                  print(z1.imag)  # 3.0
                  print(z1.conjugate())  # (2-3j)


**1. Numeric Data Types in Python (int, float):**

- Python supports two primary numeric data types: `int` for integers and `float` for floating-point numbers.
- Integers are whole numbers, and floats can represent both whole and fractional numbers.
- You can perform arithmetic operations on these types, including addition, subtraction, multiplication, division, and more.
- Be aware of potential issues with floating-point precision, which can lead to small inaccuracies in calculations.
- Python also provides built-in functions for mathematical operations, such as `abs()`, `round()`, and `math` module for advanced functions.

2. **Sequence Types:**
   - **str**: Represents strings (sequences of characters). Example: `text = "Hello, World"`
   - **list**: Represents lists (ordered, mutable sequences). Example: `my_list = [1, 2, 3]`
   - **tuple**: Represents tuples (ordered, immutable sequences). Example: `my_tuple = (1, 2, 3)`

3. **Mapping Type:**
   - **dict**: Represents dictionaries (key-value pairs). Example: `my_dict = {'name': 'John', 'age': 30}`

4. **Set Types:**
   - **set**: Represents sets (unordered collections of unique elements). Example: `my_set = {1, 2, 3}`
   - **frozenset**: Represents immutable sets. Example: `my_frozenset = frozenset([1, 2, 3])`

5. **Boolean Type:**
   - **bool**: Represents Boolean values (`True` or `False`). Example: `is_valid = True`

6. **Binary Types:**
   - **bytes**: Represents immutable sequences of bytes. Example: `data = b'Hello'`
   - **bytearray**: Represents mutable sequences of bytes. Example: `data = bytearray(b'Hello')`

7. **None Type:**
   - **NoneType**: Represents the `None` object, which is used to indicate the absence of a value or a null value.

8. **Custom Data Types:**
   - You can also define your custom data types using classes and objects.
